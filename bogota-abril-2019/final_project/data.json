Typically, JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a JavaScript everywhere paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts."

The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for themselves and their customers."

It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC) and modelâ€“viewâ€“viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications. (This flexibility has led to the acronym MVW, which stands for model-view-whatever and may also encompass modelâ€“viewâ€“presenter and modelâ€“viewâ€“adapter.) In 2014, the original AngularJS team began working on the Angular application platform."
