My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

- In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!
- Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
- Multiply each number by itself.
- Add them all together.
- Take the square root of the result.
- Divide by two.

Example: predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86.

Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.
